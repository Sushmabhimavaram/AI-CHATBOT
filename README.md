This project is a web-based AI chatbot built using the Flask web framework in Python. It uses the Ollama API to communicate with the Mistral language model, a powerful AI that generates human-like responses to user inputs.

The application allows users to enter text into a form, sends the input to the Mistral model via the Ollama API, and displays the AI-generated response back on the web page. If the response contains code, it formats it nicely using HTML <pre><code> tags.
